# economics-visualizations

A python visualization program that pulls data from the gdp_debt.csv file which was downloaded from the World Bank:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS?view=chart

The csv file has to be in the same folder as the Python script for it to work. After running the Python script a new .svg file will be created in the same folder which then has to be open in a browser for interactive viewing.
